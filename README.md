# Coursera Course Project: Getting and Cleansing Data

Execute the run_analysis.R script.

The script does the following:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The transformations that are performed is captured in the Codebook.md file. 

The output from the script is stored in a file called `tidy.txt` and is based on the tidy data principles.
